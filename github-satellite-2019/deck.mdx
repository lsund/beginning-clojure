# Main Takaways

## Automation

## Open source: the network and the community

## New features

---

## Automation

- CI/CD
    * The whole deployment process should be automated
    * Start small with but at least start!
    * CI sometimes less risky than big deployments
    * Good tools available: https://drone.io/
- Make testing central and automated
    * Fast commit / PR checks are essential
    * Try to split up testing into unit tests (always run)
        and integration tests (sometimes run)

---

## Open source: The Network and the Community

* Open source is about the people, **the network**
    - Github is a social network for software development
    - Open source open ups new ways of collaboration and funding: https://www.clojuriststogether.org/ is role model
    - Open source helps science: The scientists generating the black whole
